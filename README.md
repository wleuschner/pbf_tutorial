Position Based Fluids 2D Tutorial

This is the implementation of Position Based Fluids in 2D for a tutorial I made at https://wleusch.wordpress.com/position-based-fluids-2d/.

To build this implementation, Qt5, glm, OpenMP and OpenCL are required. In this implementation you can play around with borders by right-clicking into the canvas and dragging a border line. Particles can be added by left-clicking and and moving the mouse in the canvas. The step button simulates a single solver step, whereas the start/stop button continuously updates the simulation. In the view menu, the visualization of the particles pressure can be activated. Last but not least, you can play around with the parameters in the GUI.
